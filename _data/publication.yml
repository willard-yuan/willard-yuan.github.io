#  abstract: >
#    Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is becoming
#    an increasingly important technique in large-scale problems.
#    Recently many approaches have been developed due to fast
#    query and low storage cost. Although most of them have realized
#    the importance of the data structure, they neglected
#    the sparse relationship of the data. To build a balance between
#    the adjusted covariance matrix and the minimum reconstruction
#    error of data points, this paper proposes a novel
#    method based on sparse reconstruction to learn more compact
#    binary codes under l21-norm constraint. Experiments
#    demonstrate that the proposed method, named as sparse
#    reconstruction hashing, outperforms several other state-ofthe-
#    art methods when tested on a few benchmark datasets.
